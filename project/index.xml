      <title>Democracy and Digital Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital media has changed the way public spheres function around the world, specifically in the information environment of the internet. Moving from mostly one-to-many communication to a many-to-many system has increased its complexity. In addition, big platforms are curating information flows algorithmically and optimize them for engagement. Our goal is to better understand how those transitions are affecting democracies globally and political behaviour in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenomena such as affective polarization, the rise of populism, the spread of misinformation and diminishing trust in institutions are potential developments of concern. For us, tools from data science, but also causal inference and experimentation, are essential to achieve this goal of empirically describing the complex mechanisms at play between human behavior, technology and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central research questions are: How is public discourse shaped by social networks and sorting algorithms, and how does it benefit certain rhetoric? How do generated images affect attention and emotions and how do they reinforce certain narratives more than others? Establishing causality between these factors in such complex socio-technical systems is an overarching challenge that we aim to address.
To achieve this, we are convinced that looking at those systems from various angles is crucial. While the overarching questions span the whole research groups, we are composed of a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and methods. Digitalization is not only impacting social systems, but also expanding the methods for studying them and enabling us to cover a spectrum of measurements of human behavior between micro and macro levels, ranging from online experiments to field studies in social media and large-scale platform data analysis, while computer simulations may help connect the scales.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Political Representation on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://css-synosys.github.io/project/nlp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who do politicians represent on social media, and how? It is evident that no single party represents the entire population. Conservative parties often align with traditional middle- to upper-class families, while social democratic parties historically represent the working class. Yet, if certain social groups are excluded from representation altogether, this constitutes a democratic deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research examines two complementary dimensions of political representation: policy responsiveness and group appeal. In other words, to what extent do politicians respond to the policy preferences of specific social groups, and which groups do they explicitly address? We investigate these questions through the social media communication of members of parliament across multiple Western countries. Because social media lacks the gatekeeping function of traditional media, it allows politicians to communicate more freely and frequently, creating a unique opportunity for researchers to study political communication at greater scale and granularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining the perspectives of responsiveness and appeal, our research addresses core pillars of representative democracy in the digital age. Do parties primarily respond to citizens or to rival parties? When politicians appeal to certain groups, do they do so by drawing boundaries against an out-group or by advancing policies in their in-group’s interest? And if it is the latter, do politicians actually understand the policy preferences of the groups they seek to represent?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Psychology of Digital Propaganda</title>
      <link>https://css-synosys.github.io/project/propaganda/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, worries are growing about the unchecked power of social media and manipulative content, further enhanced by generative AI. As viral content is believed to shape public opinions, the question of how exactly these forces influence individual and collective beliefs, attitudes, and behavior has never been more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses on Digital Propaganda, which we understand as orchestrated efforts by various actors—be they political, corporate, or ideological—to influence the public for their own benefit. Leveraging user data and the attention-maximization of feed algorithms, today’s social media and digital platforms enable these campaigns to operate with greater precision and scale than ever before, far surpassing what was possible with television or radio alone. By personalizing messages, repeating them relentlessly, simplifying complex issues into stark narratives, and amplifying emotionally charged content, this new digital environment intensifies the potential to shock, polarize, and manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these tactics clearly exploit known cognitive biases and emotional reactivity, we still lack precise causal evidence of how exactly they shape people’s feelings, beliefs, and behaviors. Many assume digital propaganda wields manipulative power, yet a deeper understanding of which elements of human cognition and behavior are truly affected—and in what ways—remains elusive. Through large-scale experimentation, computational modeling, and psychologically driven and AI-supported analysis of social media content, we aim to bring robust empirical evidence to the table to uncover these mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, by bridging these knowledge gaps, we seek to lay the groundwork for evidence-based psychological interventions that empower individuals to recognize and resist manipulative strategies. At the same time, our findings will offer crucial insights for policymakers and platform regulators, helping them craft balanced measures that safeguard users from harmful content while upholding the essential values of open dialogue and informed participation.&lt;/p&gt;
