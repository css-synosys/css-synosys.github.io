      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kamil is a postdoc in the junior research group &amp;ldquo;Computational Social Science.&amp;rdquo; Trained as a psychologist, he specializes in understanding how individuals make decisions under risk and uncertainty. His core research interests focus on the (dis)adaptive roles of emotions and heuristics in decision-making and the dynamics of the decision-making process itself. Kamil’s research motivation is fueled by challenges in health-related decisions, such as vaccine hesitancy and food choices, and the impact of contemporary affective (emotional) propaganda on political preferences. His work integrates various methods, including computational modeling, behavioral and process-tracing experiments, and automated analysis of subjective reports with large language models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preprint on text-level Misinformation on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://css-synosys.github.io/post/rac_misinfo_detection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a new preprint, Sami Nenno together with Kamil Fuławka and Philipp Lorenz-Spreen from our team and Cornelius Puschmann from the University of Bremen use a new text-based method to detect misinformation on social media. The study analyzes more than half a million posts from all German members of parliament and their official party accounts across Facebook, X, Instagram, and TikTok. Using a novel text-matching approach, the researchers link posts to over 5,000 fact-checking articles and 1,500 community notes. Compared to other methods, they identify ten times as many posts that contain misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings show that misinformation remains relatively rare overall but is not evenly distributed. Instead, it clusters around certain parties and topics — in some contexts reaching misinformation rates of about ten percent. By going beyond link-based detection, this approach broadens the scope of misinformation research, providing a more detailed view of where and by whom misinformation is spread, and highlighting the central role of certain parties in its circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How people say they feel about uncertainty does not match how they decide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How people say they feel about uncertainty does not match how they decide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kamil Fuławka from our Computational Social Science group, together with colleagues Yannik Paul and Anya Pedersen from Kiel University, has published a new article in &lt;em&gt;Computational Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;. The study &lt;em&gt;“Decomposing Intolerance of Uncertainty: No Association With Affective Decision Making in a Community Sample”&lt;/em&gt; addresses a central question in psychology: &lt;strong&gt;How do people respond to uncertainty, and what drives these responses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is considered a key factor across many psychological disorders, from anxiety to obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Yet the mechanisms behind it remain unclear. To explore this, the authors identified three possible pathways: overweighting negative outcomes, distorting probabilities of rare events, and discomfort with missing information. They then mapped these mechanisms onto well-known patterns of human decision-making described by Cumulative Prospect Theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this link, the team designed an experiment with 100 participants. Instead of abstract lotteries with money, they used medical scenarios in which people had to choose between two hypothetical painkillers, each with possible side effects and varying chances of success. In one condition, all information was provided upfront. In the other, participants had to discover probabilities by sampling outcomes themselves. This allowed the researchers to compare decision-making under risk with decision-making under uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results confirmed that participants displayed common biases: they overweighed side effects compared to benefits (loss aversion), and they distorted small probabilities. Choices also differed depending on whether information was described or experienced, echoing the well-known description–experience gap. However, none of these behavioral patterns correlated with how strongly individuals reported disliking uncertainty on questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding is important because it suggests that self-reported intolerance of uncertainty and observable decision-making behavior may capture different aspects of the phenomenon. The study points to the need for more precise definitions of IU and for experimental designs that can create stronger affective contexts, possibly with real consequences for behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preprint on decision-making and large language models</title>
      <link>https://css-synosys.github.io/post/preprint-25/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can large language models help us understand the psychology of risky choice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kamil Fulawka&lt;/strong&gt; is the first author of a new preprint that tackles this question. Together with Ralph Hertwig and Dirk Wulff, he introduces a scalable approach to analyze participants’ free-text explanations of their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study shows that LLMs can accurately identify the reasons people give for their lottery choices in more than 92% of cases. These verbal reports reveal systematic patterns: people’s reasoning depends strongly on the structure of the choice problem rather than being fixed across individuals. Models built on these reason profiles also achieve higher predictive accuracy than prospect theory, one of the most established frameworks in decision science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By demonstrating the scientific value of verbal data, this work opens new avenues for developing context-aware models of human decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉 A more detailed description of the analysis, as well as the code and data, can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/yuzmw_v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online platforms generate vast amounts of behavioral data, including subjective ratings (e.g., likes, stars, reactions) and objective engagement metrics (e.g., views, clicks, watch time). While machine learning excels at predicting user behavior, statistical modeling—a cornerstone of empirical research—is critical for interpretable analysis. It helps uncover relationships between user behavior and various factors (e.g., how demographics influence engagement patterns) and enables causal inference in experiments (e.g., measuring the impact of different feed-ranking algorithms on user experience). These methods are widely used in UX research, product analytics, and A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course provides a hands-on introduction to statistical modeling in R, focusing on methods most useful for analyzing behavioral data. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover key concepts and progress to model selection based on outcome type. Topics include logistic regression for binary outcomes (e.g., like/dislike reactions), ordinal regression for rating scales, beta regression for continuous feedback (e.g., sliders), and hierarchical models for nested data (e.g., multiple ratings from the same users). In the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll not only know which model to use but also how to effectively visualize and communicate your findings through clear, interpretable result presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No prior statistical modeling experience is required. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Python or similar languages, the transition to R should be easy. All scripts and exercises are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Psychology of Digital Propaganda</title>
      <link>https://css-synosys.github.io/project/propaganda/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, worries are growing about the unchecked power of social media and manipulative content, further enhanced by generative AI. As viral content is believed to shape public opinions, the question of how exactly these forces influence individual and collective beliefs, attitudes, and behavior has never been more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses on Digital Propaganda, which we understand as orchestrated efforts by various actors—be they political, corporate, or ideological—to influence the public for their own benefit. Leveraging user data and the attention-maximization of feed algorithms, today’s social media and digital platforms enable these campaigns to operate with greater precision and scale than ever before, far surpassing what was possible with television or radio alone. By personalizing messages, repeating them relentlessly, simplifying complex issues into stark narratives, and amplifying emotionally charged content, this new digital environment intensifies the potential to shock, polarize, and manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these tactics clearly exploit known cognitive biases and emotional reactivity, we still lack precise causal evidence of how exactly they shape people’s feelings, beliefs, and behaviors. Many assume digital propaganda wields manipulative power, yet a deeper understanding of which elements of human cognition and behavior are truly affected—and in what ways—remains elusive. Through large-scale experimentation, computational modeling, and psychologically driven and AI-supported analysis of social media content, we aim to bring robust empirical evidence to the table to uncover these mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, by bridging these knowledge gaps, we seek to lay the groundwork for evidence-based psychological interventions that empower individuals to recognize and resist manipulative strategies. At the same time, our findings will offer crucial insights for policymakers and platform regulators, helping them craft balanced measures that safeguard users from harmful content while upholding the essential values of open dialogue and informed participation.&lt;/p&gt;
