&lt;p&gt;Time  Thursdays, 5. DS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language  English&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment  oral exam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online platforms generate vast amounts of behavioral data, including subjective ratings (e.g., likes, stars, reactions) and objective engagement metrics (e.g., views, clicks, watch time). While machine learning excels at predicting user behavior, statistical modeling—a cornerstone of empirical research—is critical for interpretable analysis. It helps uncover relationships between user behavior and various factors (e.g., how demographics influence engagement patterns) and enables causal inference in experiments (e.g., measuring the impact of different feed-ranking algorithms on user experience). These methods are widely used in UX research, product analytics, and A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course provides a hands-on introduction to statistical modeling in R, focusing on methods most useful for analyzing behavioral data. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover key concepts and progress to model selection based on outcome type. Topics include logistic regression for binary outcomes (e.g., like/dislike reactions), ordinal regression for rating scales, beta regression for continuous feedback (e.g., sliders), and hierarchical models for nested data (e.g., multiple ratings from the same users). In the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll not only know which model to use but also how to effectively visualize and communicate your findings through clear, interpretable result presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No prior statistical modeling experience is required. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Python or similar languages, the transition to R should be easy. All scripts and exercises are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kamil is a postdoc in the junior research group &amp;ldquo;Computational Social Science.&amp;rdquo; Trained as a psychologist, he specializes in understanding how individuals make decisions under risk and uncertainty. His core research interests focus on the (dis)adaptive roles of emotions and heuristics in decision-making and the dynamics of the decision-making process itself. Kamil’s research motivation is fueled by challenges in health-related decisions, such as vaccine hesitancy and food choices, and the impact of contemporary affective (emotional) propaganda on political preferences. His work integrates various methods, including computational modeling, behavioral and process-tracing experiments, and automated analysis of subjective reports with large language models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Psychology of Digital Propaganda</title>
      <link>https://css-synosys.github.io/project/propaganda/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, worries are growing about the unchecked power of social media and manipulative content, further enhanced by generative AI. As viral content is believed to shape public opinions, the question of how exactly these forces influence individual and collective beliefs, attitudes, and behavior has never been more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses on Digital Propaganda, which we understand as orchestrated efforts by various actors—be they political, corporate, or ideological—to influence the public for their own benefit. Leveraging user data and the attention-maximization of feed algorithms, today’s social media and digital platforms enable these campaigns to operate with greater precision and scale than ever before, far surpassing what was possible with television or radio alone. By personalizing messages, repeating them relentlessly, simplifying complex issues into stark narratives, and amplifying emotionally charged content, this new digital environment intensifies the potential to shock, polarize, and manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these tactics clearly exploit known cognitive biases and emotional reactivity, we still lack precise causal evidence of how exactly they shape people’s feelings, beliefs, and behaviors. Many assume digital propaganda wields manipulative power, yet a deeper understanding of which elements of human cognition and behavior are truly affected—and in what ways—remains elusive. Through large-scale experimentation, computational modeling, and psychologically driven and AI-supported analysis of social media content, we aim to bring robust empirical evidence to the table to uncover these mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, by bridging these knowledge gaps, we seek to lay the groundwork for evidence-based psychological interventions that empower individuals to recognize and resist manipulative strategies. At the same time, our findings will offer crucial insights for policymakers and platform regulators, helping them craft balanced measures that safeguard users from harmful content while upholding the essential values of open dialogue and informed participation.&lt;/p&gt;
