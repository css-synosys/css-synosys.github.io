&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media generates new types of data for quantifying human behavior, but also raises interesting research questions about the interaction between technology and society. In this course, we will learn the basics of computational social science, with a focus on text-as-data, and apply its methods to real-world data science problems from social media and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture will introduce you to social science research questions and findings, while the exercise will give you the practical skills to answer social questions yourself using computational tools. The first part focuses on basic techniques of text analysis. We will learn how to collect text data from sources such as newspapers, parliamentary minutes or social media, and how to pre-process it for natural language processing (NLP), such as sentiment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then move on to analyzing the structural factors of online data, from time series to networks and their dynamics. We will also explore how to collect such data from social media and how to conduct online field experiments. We will then have the tools to move on to applied research questions, covering topics such as political polarization, misinformation, public health and human mobility. We will learn what conclusions can and cannot be drawn from these descriptions. Finally, we will go beyond description and learn about causality, simulation models of social systems that allow mechanistic understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the course will focus on NLP again, this time with a focus on deep learning methods such as Large Language Models (LLMs). We will use transformer models to identify complex patterns in the communication of German parties on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this course will provide a toolbox for describing different types of social systems with a focus on textual data, as well as a family of modelling approaches that can go beyond individual-level statistics to describe collective processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Text as Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Big data and computational power are growing fast, and it&amp;rsquo;s not just the big tech companies making use of it. Social sciences are also benefiting from these advances. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has come a long way, and now researchers can analyze text data in ways that were impossible just a few decades ago. Social media posts, transcripts of political debates, and parliamentary speeches are now valuable data sources for studying human behavior, political discourse, and societal trends. This opens up a bunch of new questions and gives us new ways to study them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our “Text-as-Data” project uses NLP methods to analyze how politicians communicate across social media and other channels. We investigate the dynamics of disinformation, examining how false or misleading information spreads and evolves within political communication. Understanding these patterns is crucial in an age of eroding trust in democratic institutions and polarized societies. We also study how different groups of citizens are addressed, shedding light on patterns of political inequality in messaging. This is important for assessing whether political communication reflects or exacerbates existing social divides, and for ensuring that all voices are equally valued in public discourse. Additionally, we analyze whether there has been an ideological shift in political discourse in recent years, helping us understand how political narratives adapt to societal changes and shape public opinion. By addressing these challenges, our research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of contemporary political dynamics and the role of communication in shaping democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, we are creating new methods to combine data from different sources. This lets us find connections and trends across different types of communication. This approach helps us understand political communication better. It also gives us new tools and frameworks for analyzing complex social phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
