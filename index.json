While the overarching questions span the whole research groups, we are composed of a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and methods.

He has made it clear in posts, articles and election events that he is a fan - and at the same time, Alice Weidel’s reach on X has increased significantly. Could these developments be linked? This blog post describes a data analysis in which we take a closer look at which accounts have received how much reach and whether Musk’s influence can be determined. Where does the sudden increase in Weidel’s reach on X come from?\nNote: This work has not yet been peer reviewed. A more detailed description of the analysis, the methods, as well as the code and data can be found here.\nIn recent weeks, there has been a lot of fuss about Elon Musk’s possible influence in favour of the AfD. First, on 20 December, he wrote on his platform X (formerly Twitter) that only the AfD can save Germany. On 28 December, Die Welt published a guest article by Musk in which he expressed the same position. Finally, on 9 January, he held a public conversation on X with the AfD candidate Alice Weidel.\nAs already reported in one place or another, Weidel gained a lot of reach on X. The German parliamentary administration then announced that it would investigate whether Musk is influencing the election campaign. At the same time, the EU Commission is demanding insight into possible changes to X’s recommendation algorithms. This article analyses the possible impact of Musk’s activities on the reach of the AfD and Weidel in particular on social media.\nFigure 1 Number of followers of various German politicians (top) and views of Weidel’s posts with and without retweets from Elon Musk (bottom, retweets outlined in red).\nWeidel’s jumps in reach often coincide with Musk’s expressions of sympathy\nLet’s start with the number of follows on X (Fig. 1, top). For the politicians Lindner, Scholz, Merz and Habeck, we see how the number usually grows: slow and steady. It is different with Weidel. We see two sharp jumps and a steady but faster increase in between. The first increase occurred around 20 December. At this time, Musk posted that only the AfD could save Germany and also mentioned the AfD in other posts. However, these were only mentions (with and without links) and not retweets. This is an important difference. In the case of a retweet, the original post also appears in Musk’s timeline and, as he is followed by over 200 million people, this automatically generates a lot of reach. With ‘mere’ mentions, those who follow Musk first have to go to the respective profile of the account mentioned and that is often a bigger hurdle.\nAround 28 December - Musk’s contribution to Die Welt - he retweeted a post by Weidel for the first time (in which she thanked him for the guest article). This post has 15 million views (Fig. 1, below, outlined in red). However, the public conversation with Musk seems to have had a particular impact on the number of her followers. In the days leading up to 9 January, Musk mentioned and retweeted Alice Weidel several times, which earned her as many as 24 million views for one post, and on 10 January her number of followers increased by almost 150.000.\nFigure 1 shows that individual posts by Weidel that were retweeted by Musk received a large number of views. However, individual posts without retweets also have a high reach. In order to find out whether there was a specific point in time when Weidel’s views started to increase, we carried out a so-called changepoint analysis. Roughly speaking, this method is used to find out whether the data can be better described with one or two trend lines and, if there are two, where the break should be made. The analysis showed that there was already a significant break on 16 December. On that day, Olaf Scholz lost the vote of confidence in the German parliament. The two trend lines are shown in red in the lower part of Figure 1. You can see that the second line is well above the first. In the first period, Weidel’s posts received an average of almost 140.000 views, then almost 790.000.\nA few retweets with a wide reach have created views for Weidel’s posts\nFigure 2 Development of the views of Weidel’s posts over a period of 36 hours. Note: The post in the centre is no longer available, but it was also announced on Alice Weidel’s website.\nLet’s now take a closer look at Weidel’s posts. To do this, we regularly accessed X over a longer period of time so that we could not only record the absolute numbers, but also their development, i.e. how quickly they grow. Figure 2 shows the six most viewed posts by Alice Weidel and their dynamics over 36 hours. The dashed lines show the time at which Musk mentioned Weidel and the red lines show that this post was even retweeted by Musk. Two things are striking about the posts that were retweeted. Firstly, these tend to have the most views and secondly, the views only jump in these cases and this always takes place shortly after the post was retweeted by Musk. We were unable to find similar jumps for …","date":1737676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1737676800,"objectID":"0cd5767c697e530f5d6de0b59e0de764","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/post/x_election/","publishdate":"2025-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/x_election/","section":"post","summary":"Has Elon Musk manipulated X to give the AfD more reach?

As viral content is believed to shape public opinions, the question of how exactly these forces influence individual and collective beliefs, attitudes, and behavior has never been more urgent.\nOur research focuses on Digital Propaganda, which we understand as orchestrated efforts by various actors—be they political, corporate, or ideological—to influence the public for their own benefit. Leveraging user data and the attention-maximization of feed algorithms, today’s social media and digital platforms enable these campaigns to operate with greater precision and scale than ever before, far surpassing what was possible with television or radio alone. By personalizing messages, repeating them relentlessly, simplifying complex issues into stark narratives, and amplifying emotionally charged content, this new digital environment intensifies the potential to shock, polarize, and manipulate.\nAlthough these tactics clearly exploit known cognitive biases and emotional reactivity, we still lack precise causal evidence of how exactly they shape people’s feelings, beliefs, and behaviors. Many assume digital propaganda wields manipulative power, yet a deeper understanding of which elements of human cognition and behavior are truly affected—and in what ways—remains elusive. Through large-scale experimentation, computational modeling, and psychologically driven and AI-supported analysis of social media content, we aim to bring robust empirical evidence to the table to uncover these mechanisms.\nUltimately, by bridging these knowledge gaps, we seek to lay the groundwork for evidence-based psychological interventions that empower individuals to recognize and resist manipulative strategies. At the same time, our findings will offer crucial insights for policymakers and platform regulators, helping them craft balanced measures that safeguard users from harmful content while upholding the essential values of open dialogue and informed participation.\n","date":1737676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1737676800,"objectID":"f9d11eb37429dc6a5f66aff3962e6e26","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/project/propaganda/","publishdate":"2025-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/propaganda/","section":"project","summary":"Across the globe, worries are growing about the unchecked power of social media and manipulative content, further enhanced by generative AI.

Social media posts, transcripts of political debates, and parliamentary speeches are now valuable data sources for studying human behavior, political discourse, and societal trends. This opens up a bunch of new questions and gives us new ways to study them.\nOur “Text-as-Data” project uses NLP methods to analyze how politicians communicate across social media and other channels. We investigate the dynamics of disinformation, examining how false or misleading information spreads and evolves within political communication. Understanding these patterns is crucial in an age of eroding trust in democratic institutions and polarized societies. We also study how different groups of citizens are addressed, shedding light on patterns of political inequality in messaging. This is important for assessing whether political communication reflects or exacerbates existing social divides, and for ensuring that all voices are equally valued in public discourse. Additionally, we analyze whether there has been an ideological shift in political discourse in recent years, helping us understand how political narratives adapt to societal changes and shape public opinion. By addressing these challenges, our research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of contemporary political dynamics and the role of communication in shaping democracy.\nTo answer these questions, we are creating new methods to combine data from different sources.

News Values in Perceived Misinformation Across Twenty-Four Countries. Co-written with Cornelius Puschmann, the study has been published in The International Journal of Press/Politics and investigates the relationship between journalistic news values and perceived misinformation in diverse national contexts.\nThe research addresses a notable gap in the understanding of how misinformation is shaped and perceived globally. While much of the previous scholarship has focused on misinformation within WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries, this study expands the scope by including both WEIRD and non-WEIRD regions. Using a dataset of over 770,000 Facebook-shared URLs flagged as misinformation by users, the study analyzes the prevalence of five key news values: conflict, negativity, proximity, individualization, and informativeness. Through computational analysis, the authors explore how these news values appear in flagged and unflagged content and assess their variation across 24 countries.\nThe research reveals that flagged content, often perceived as misinformation, tends to emphasize conflict and negativity more strongly than unflagged content. Other news values, such as proximity and individualization, also appear more prominently in flagged items, though with varying intensity. Significant differences in the prevalence of news values were observed between WEIRD and non-WEIRD countries. For instance, proximity and negativity were found to be more pronounced in WEIRD countries, whereas individualization was more prevalent in non-WEIRD contexts. The study also highlights unique patterns in countries such as the United States and Brazil, where conflict and negativity were particularly dominant in flagged content.\nThe findings challenge existing frameworks of news values, which were primarily developed within Western contexts, by showing that these models may not fully account for the diversity of global media landscapes. This emphasizes the need for more inclusive theoretical models that better reflect regional and cultural differences.\nThis study contributes to the growing field of misinformation research by providing a global perspective on how news values intersect with perceived misinformation. It highlights the influence of journalistic styles and national media systems on the characteristics of flagged content, offering valuable insights for academics, journalists, and policymakers seeking to address the challenges posed by misinformation.\nThis publication was part of Sami Nenno’s PhD project and was written during his time at the University of Bremen and at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

One approach to mitigating the effect of misinformation focuses on individual-level interventions, equipping policymakers and the public with essential tools to curb the spread and influence of falsehoods. Here we introduce a toolbox of individual-level interventions for reducing harm from online misinformation. Comprising an up-to-date account of interventions featured in 81 scientific papers from across the globe, the toolbox provides both a conceptual overview of nine main types of interventions, including their target, scope and examples, and a summary of the empirical evidence supporting the interventions, including the methods and experimental paradigms used to test them. The nine types of interventions covered are accuracy prompts, debunking and rebuttals, friction, inoculation, lateral reading and verification strategies, media-literacy tips, social norms, source-credibility labels, and warning and fact-checking labels.","tags":["review","complex systems","opinion dynamics"],"title":"Toolbox of individual-level interventions against online misinformation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Sultan","A N Tump","N Ehmann","Philipp Lorenz-Spreen","R Hertwig","A Gollwitzer","R Kurvers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1714694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706632267,"objectID":"6fdcabb727f8f525c87dc067c9291f5f","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/publication/phillipp-2024-susceptibility/","publishdate":"2024-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phillipp-2024-susceptibility/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite a surge of research into misinformation, it is largely unclear who falls for misinformation and why. We conducted a systematic individual participant data meta-analysis covering 256,337 unique choices made by 11,561 participants across 31 experiments. Our metaanalysis reveals the impact of key demographic and psychological factors on online misinformation veracity judgments. We also disentangle the ability to discern between true and false news (discrimination ability) from the response bias, that is, a tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false-news bias). We find that older age, higher analytic thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Older age and higher analytical thinking skills are also associated with a false-news bias (caution). In contrast, ideological congruency, motivated reflection, and familiarity are associated with a true-news bias (naïvety). Our results touch upon ongoing debates in the literature and provide critical insights that can help design targeted interventions.","tags":["review","complex systems","opinion dynamics","meta-analysis"],"title":"Susceptibility to Online Misinformation: A Systematic Meta-Analysis of Demographic and Psychological Factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Nickl","M Moussaïd","Philipp Lorenz-Spreen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1714694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706632267,"objectID":"68550b18413641fc2604044637360f01","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/publication/phillipp-2024-evolution/","publishdate":"2024-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phillipp-2024-evolution/","section":"publication","summary":"In a crowded marketplace where everybody is shouting, how do people decide who to listen to? As a vendor facing growing competition, what would you shout to get people’s attention? Imagine you had access to everything every vendor has called out, since the market became more competitive. You could study how their language has developed over the years and look for clues about what works: A coherent pattern would indicate an adaptation to the changing system. In the present study, the marketplace in question is the online digital environment, the market cries are news headlines, the vendors are content producers (journalists and editors), the consumers are readers, and the currency is their limited attention. In the digital age, large amounts of content can be produced quickly and inexpensively, and transmitted and stored with high fidelity (Acerbi, 2019). From an economic perspective this represents a contestable market (Munger, 2020): because up-front costs are low, entry to this market is potentially open to many more content producers. An abundance of content means increased competition for limited attention, fiercer algorithmic, social and personal selection, and a higher turnover of content (Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2019), a situation aptly described as an attention economy (Simon et al., 1971). With an overabundance of content, only a small fraction of content eventually reaches the user, even less is ultimately consumed and engaged with (see González-Bailón et al., 2023 for the funnel of engagement). Increasingly, content is readily created to fit demand and further optimized through audience feedback, exploiting human …","tags":["complex systems","opinion dynamics"],"title":"The Evolution of Online News Headlines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The Legal Notice of TU Dresden applies with the following amendments:\nRESPONSIBILITIES If you have any questions regarding content, please contact: Dirk Brockmann Technische Universität Dresden DE – 01062 Dresden Email: dirk.brockmann@tu-dresden.de Telephone: +49 351 463-33199\nTechnical implementation:\nTechnische Universität Dresden Institution / Department Center for Synergy of Systems Georg-Schumann-Straße 7A 01069 Dresden Head: Dirk Brockmann Email: dirk.brockmann@tu-dresden.de\nDATA PROTECTION DECLARATION TU Dresden processes personal data for the use of the public website https://synosys.github.io).
