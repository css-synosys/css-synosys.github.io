In real time, we linked each of N= 2, 762 individual posts (retweets and newly created content) with the self-reported motives from a sample of N= 137 highly active US Twitter users over the course of one week. We also captured their total activity of N= 48, 419 posts over 10 weeks (March-May 2022). Our results reveal that sharing (retweeting) political content stemmed mostly from motives related to expression and identity. When creating content, participants were more likely to be motivated by the goals of informing and persuading others, for which they used negative language and expressed outrage. In contrast, entertaining content and positive language was used for socializing and attention. Original and political content featuring outrage and anger was more likely to be subsequently retweeted by others. These findings may denote adaptive strategies in the incentive structure of social media that rewards such content.","tags":["twitter","contact networks","complex systems","opinion dynamics"],"title":"Real-time assessment of motives for sharing and creating content among highly active Twitter users","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Kozyreva","Philipp Lorenz-Spreen","S M.

One approach to mitigating the effect of misinformation focuses on individual-level interventions, equipping policymakers and the public with essential tools to curb the spread and influence of falsehoods. Here we introduce a toolbox of individual-level interventions for reducing harm from online misinformation. Comprising an up-to-date account of interventions featured in 81 scientific papers from across the globe, the toolbox provides both a conceptual overview of nine main types of interventions, including their target, scope and examples, and a summary of the empirical evidence supporting the interventions, including the methods and experimental paradigms used to test them. The nine types of interventions covered are accuracy prompts, debunking and rebuttals, friction, inoculation, lateral reading and verification strategies, media-literacy tips, social norms, source-credibility labels, and warning and fact-checking labels.","tags":["review","complex systems","opinion dynamics"],"title":"Toolbox of individual-level interventions against online misinformation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Sultan","A N Tump","N Ehmann","Philipp Lorenz-Spreen","R Hertwig","A Gollwitzer","R Kurvers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1714694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706632267,"objectID":"6fdcabb727f8f525c87dc067c9291f5f","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/publication/phillipp-2024-susceptibility/","publishdate":"2024-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phillipp-2024-susceptibility/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite a surge of research into misinformation, it is largely unclear who falls for misinformation and why. We conducted a systematic individual participant data meta-analysis covering 256,337 unique choices made by 11,561 participants across 31 experiments. Our metaanalysis reveals the impact of key demographic and psychological factors on online misinformation veracity judgments. We also disentangle the ability to discern between true and false news (discrimination ability) from the response bias, that is, a tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false-news bias). We find that older age, higher analytic thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Older age and higher analytical thinking skills are also associated with a false-news bias (caution). In contrast, ideological congruency, motivated reflection, and familiarity are associated with a true-news bias (naïvety). Our results touch upon ongoing debates in the literature and provide critical insights that can help design targeted interventions.","tags":["review","complex systems","opinion dynamics","meta-analysis"],"title":"Susceptibility to Online Misinformation: A Systematic Meta-Analysis of Demographic and Psychological Factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Nickl","M Moussaïd","Philipp Lorenz-Spreen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1714694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706632267,"objectID":"68550b18413641fc2604044637360f01","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/publication/phillipp-2024-evolution/","publishdate":"2024-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phillipp-2024-evolution/","section":"publication","summary":"In a crowded marketplace where everybody is shouting, how do people decide who to listen to? As a vendor facing growing competition, what would you shout to get people’s attention? Imagine you had access to everything every vendor has called out, since the market became more competitive. You could study how their language has developed over the years and look for clues about what works: A coherent pattern would indicate an adaptation to the changing system. In the present study, the marketplace in question is the online digital environment, the market cries are news headlines, the vendors are content producers (journalists and editors), the consumers are readers, and the currency is their limited attention. In the digital age, large amounts of content can be produced quickly and inexpensively, and transmitted and stored with high fidelity (Acerbi, 2019). From an economic perspective this represents a contestable market (Munger, 2020): because up-front costs are low, entry to this market is potentially open to many more content producers. An abundance of content means increased competition for limited attention, fiercer algorithmic, social and personal selection, and a higher turnover of content (Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2019), a situation aptly described as an attention economy (Simon et al., 1971). With an overabundance of content, only a small fraction of content eventually reaches the user, even less is ultimately consumed and engaged with (see González-Bailón et al., 2023 for the funnel of engagement). Increasingly, content is readily created to fit demand and further optimized through audience feedback, exploiting human …","tags":["complex systems","opinion dynamics"],"title":"The Evolution of Online News Headlines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
