In addition, big platforms are curating information flows algorithmically and optimize them for engagement. Our goal is to better understand how those transitions are affecting democracies globally and political behaviour in particular.\nPhenomena such as affective polarization, the rise of populism, the spread of misinformation and diminishing trust in institutions are potential developments of concern. For us, tools from data science, but also causal inference and experimentation, are essential to achieve this goal of empirically describing the complex mechanisms at play between human behavior, technology and politics.\nThe central research questions are: How is public discourse shaped by social networks and sorting algorithms, and how does it benefit certain rhetoric? How do generated images affect attention and emotions and how do they reinforce certain narratives more than others? Establishing causality between these factors in such complex socio-technical systems is an overarching challenge that we aim to address. To achieve this, we are convinced that looking at those systems from various angles is crucial. While the overarching questions span the whole research groups, we are composed of a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and methods. Digitalization is not only impacting social systems, but also expanding the methods for studying them and enabling us to cover a spectrum of measurements of human behavior between micro and macro levels, ranging from online experiments to field studies in social media and large-scale platform data analysis, while computer simulations may help connect the scales.\n","date":1737676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1737676800,"objectID":"f2039bc56f41094aad6bd5db7f3c93b0","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/project/digitalmedia/","publishdate":"2025-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/digitalmedia/","section":"project","summary":"Digital media has changed the way public spheres function around the world, specifically in the information environment of the internet.

As the viral content is believed to shape public opinions, the question of how exactly these forces influence individual and collective beliefs, attitudes, and behavior has never been more urgent.\nOur research focuses on Digital Propaganda, which we understand as orchestrated efforts by various actors—be they political, corporate, or ideological—to influence the public for their own benefit. Leveraging user data and sophisticated algorithms, today’s social media and digital platforms enable these campaigns to operate with greater precision and scale than ever before, far surpassing what was possible with television or radio alone. By personalizing messages for individual users, repeating them relentlessly, simplifying complex issues into stark narratives, and amplifying emotionally charged content, this new digital environment intensifies the potential to shock, polarize, and manipulate large segments of the population.\nAlthough these tactics clearly exploit known cognitive biases and emotional reactivity, we still lack precise causal evidence of how exactly they shape people’s feelings, beliefs, and behaviors. Many assume digital propaganda wields near-absolute power, yet a deeper understanding of which elements of human cognition and behavior are truly affected—and in what ways—remains elusive. Through large-scale experimentation, computational modeling, and psychologically driven and AI-supported analysis of social media content, we aim to bring robust empirical evidence to the table to uncover these mechanisms.\nUltimately, by bridging these knowledge gaps, we seek to lay the groundwork for evidence-based psychological interventions that empower individuals to recognize and resist manipulative strategies. At the same time, our findings will offer crucial insights for policymakers and platform regulators, helping them craft balanced measures that safeguard users from harmful content while upholding the essential values of open dialogue and informed participation.\n","date":1737676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1737676800,"objectID":"f9d11eb37429dc6a5f66aff3962e6e26","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/project/propaganda/","publishdate":"2025-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/propaganda/","section":"project","summary":"Across the globe, worries are growing about the unchecked power of social media and emerging digital platforms.

We also captured their total activity of N= 48, 419 posts over 10 weeks (March-May 2022). Our results reveal that sharing (retweeting) political content stemmed mostly from motives related to expression and identity. When creating content, participants were more likely to be motivated by the goals of informing and persuading others, for which they used negative language and expressed outrage. In contrast, entertaining content and positive language was used for socializing and attention. Original and political content featuring outrage and anger was more likely to be subsequently retweeted by others. These findings may denote adaptive strategies in the incentive structure of social media that rewards such content.","tags":["twitter","contact networks","complex systems","opinion dynamics"],"title":"Real-time assessment of motives for sharing and creating content among highly active Twitter users","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Kozyreva","Philipp Lorenz-Spreen","S M.

Here we introduce a toolbox of individual-level interventions for reducing harm from online misinformation. Comprising an up-to-date account of interventions featured in 81 scientific papers from across the globe, the toolbox provides both a conceptual overview of nine main types of interventions, including their target, scope and examples, and a summary of the empirical evidence supporting the interventions, including the methods and experimental paradigms used to test them. The nine types of interventions covered are accuracy prompts, debunking and rebuttals, friction, inoculation, lateral reading and verification strategies, media-literacy tips, social norms, source-credibility labels, and warning and fact-checking labels.","tags":["review","complex systems","opinion dynamics"],"title":"Toolbox of individual-level interventions against online misinformation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Sultan","A N Tump","N Ehmann","Philipp Lorenz-Spreen","R Hertwig","A Gollwitzer","R Kurvers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1714694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706632267,"objectID":"6fdcabb727f8f525c87dc067c9291f5f","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/publication/phillipp-2024-susceptibility/","publishdate":"2024-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phillipp-2024-susceptibility/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite a surge of research into misinformation, it is largely unclear who falls for misinformation and why. We conducted a systematic individual participant data meta-analysis covering 256,337 unique choices made by 11,561 participants across 31 experiments. Our metaanalysis reveals the impact of key demographic and psychological factors on online misinformation veracity judgments. We also disentangle the ability to discern between true and false news (discrimination ability) from the response bias, that is, a tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false-news bias). We find that older age, higher analytic thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Older age and higher analytical thinking skills are also associated with a false-news bias (caution). In contrast, ideological congruency, motivated reflection, and familiarity are associated with a true-news bias (naïvety). Our results touch upon ongoing debates in the literature and provide critical insights that can help design targeted interventions.","tags":["review","complex systems","opinion dynamics","meta-analysis"],"title":"Susceptibility to Online Misinformation: A Systematic Meta-Analysis of Demographic and Psychological Factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Nickl","M Moussaïd","Philipp Lorenz-Spreen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1714694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706632267,"objectID":"68550b18413641fc2604044637360f01","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/publication/phillipp-2024-evolution/","publishdate":"2024-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phillipp-2024-evolution/","section":"publication","summary":"In a crowded marketplace where everybody is shouting, how do people decide who to listen to? As a vendor facing growing competition, what would you shout to get people’s attention? Imagine you had access to everything every vendor has called out, since the market became more competitive. You could study how their language has developed over the years and look for clues about what works: A coherent pattern would indicate an adaptation to the changing system. In the present study, the marketplace in question is the online digital environment, the market cries are news headlines, the vendors are content producers (journalists and editors), the consumers are readers, and the currency is their limited attention. In the digital age, large amounts of content can be produced quickly and inexpensively, and transmitted and stored with high fidelity (Acerbi, 2019). From an economic perspective this represents a contestable market (Munger, 2020): because up-front costs are low, entry to this market is potentially open to many more content producers. An abundance of content means increased competition for limited attention, fiercer algorithmic, social and personal selection, and a higher turnover of content (Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2019), a situation aptly described as an attention economy (Simon et al., 1971). With an overabundance of content, only a small fraction of content eventually reaches the user, even less is ultimately consumed and engaged with (see González-Bailón et al., 2023 for the funnel of engagement). Increasingly, content is readily created to fit demand and further optimized through audience feedback, exploiting human …","tags":["complex systems","opinion dynamics"],"title":"The Evolution of Online News Headlines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://css-synosys.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The Legal Notice of TU Dresden applies with the following amendments:\nRESPONSIBILITIES If you have any questions regarding content, please contact: Dirk Brockmann Technische Universität Dresden DE – 01062 Dresden Email: dirk.brockmann@tu-dresden.de Telephone: +49 351 463-33199\nTechnical implementation:\nTechnische Universität Dresden Institution / Department Center for Synergy of Systems Georg-Schumann-Straße 7A 01069 Dresden Head: Dirk Brockmann Email: dirk.brockmann@tu-dresden.de\nDATA PROTECTION DECLARATION TU Dresden processes personal data for the use of the public website https://synosys.github.io).
